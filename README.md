# COMP-354-A1
A game simulating a farm environment which accepts English input from the user
and translates it into method calls that execute actions in the in-game farm.

Purpose:
To teach young kids how to program in an object-oriented environment.
The usage of Java will help relate object-oriented concepts to the end user
through our coding simulation. Most of the architecture in our program is based
on the basics of OOP principles, the ones the user is intended to learn, such
as polymorphism, list manipulation, and conditional logic.

Dependencies:
This program is written in Java.
Jupiter JUnit is the testing framework.

Instructions:
To run this program, execute the provided executable jar file called "FarmGame.jar".
If the above does not work, use an IDE such as Eclipse and create a new project in the
directory called "FarmGame".
The test cases can also be executed through an IDE such as Eclipse, all the files that
relate to testing end with the keyword "Test".
If none of the above works, sample execution of each level is provided in .txt files.
