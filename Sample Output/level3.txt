Welcome to the Farm Game!
The purpose of this game is to teach children how to code.

Select a level by writing its number:
Level 1: Teaches the importance of object oriented programming
Level 2: Teaches IF conditions with objects
Level 3: Teaches while conditions with objects
Level 4: Brings together all of what we learned

Welcome to the third level.
Here we will begin teaching about the second condition statement, the WHILE statement.
WHILE functions similar to the IF statement where it will only execute if the statement is true.
The fundamental difference is the while condition will keep going until the statement becomes false
This can be tricky in programming since you can encounter endless loops if your while statement is always true
For this exercise we have made the animals all a certain level of hungry. The conditions statement will be
while (the animal is a hungry) do something.
I think we are ready to give this a try.


I will now explain some rules for this level.
Rule 1: All sentences must begin with "Farmer John".
Rule 2: All sentences must be at least 3 meaningful words long.
Rule 3: After the while keyword you must repeat the animal you are using (ex: farmer john cleans the pig while the pig is clean).
Rule 4: The goal for this level is to make sure all the animals are full using while statements.
Rule 5: Have fun!.
---------------------------------
The Farm is clean.
Farmer John is at the Farm.
The pig is at the Farm. It is full, sick, and filthy.
The chicken is at the Farm. It is hungry, healthy, and filthy.
The cow is at the Farm. It is hungry, sick, clean, and has milk.

Welcome to the First Level. Get ready to have fun with programming With our amazing barn game!!
My name is Farmer John. I will be your guide through out this lesson.
During this level we are going to learn all about Object Oriented programming.
An Object in programming is a data field that has unique attributes and behaviour.
Unlike a simple integer that can only be used in mathematical scenarios,you can code your objects to do whatever you wish to accomplish.
In this program, we have constructed a farm for you to interact with.
The "Objects" will be the Farmer, Locations and Animals
Your goal for this level is to make sure all the animals objects are clean!


Before we begin I must tell you about some rules to this program.
All code follows rules. If you deviate from the rules the code may not run as intended.
Rule 1: All sentences must begin with "Farmer John".
Rule 2: All sentences must be at least 3 meaningful words long.
Rule 3: The goal for this level is to clean all animals, But you can feed them, move them and nurse them as much as you want before level ends.
Rule 4: Have fun!.
