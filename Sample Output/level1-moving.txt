Welcome to the First Level. Get ready to have fun with programming With our amazing barn game!!
My name is Farmer John. I will be your guide through out this lesson.
During this level we are going to learn all about Object Oriented programming.
An Object in programming is a data field that has unique attributes and behaviour.
Unlike a simple integer that can only be used in mathematical scenarios,you can code your objects to do whatever you wish to accomplish.
In this program, we have constructed a farm for you to interact with.
The "Objects" will be the Farmer, Locations and Animals
Your goal for this level is to make sure all the animals objects are clean!


Before we begin I must tell you about some rules to this program.
All code follows rules. If you deviate from the rules the code may not run as intended.
Rule 1: All sentences must begin with "Farmer John".
Rule 2: All sentences must be at least 3 meaningful words long.
Rule 3: The goal for this level is to clean all animals, But you can feed them, move them and nurse them as much as you want before level ends.
Rule 4: Have fun!.
