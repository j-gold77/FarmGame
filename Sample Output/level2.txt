Welcome to the second Level.
Here we will begin teaching about conditions statements
The first condition statement we will begin using is an IF statement
An IF statement can only be executed if the condition given is TRUE
IF 4>2 then something will happen.
We can use ELSE after the IF statement to execute something else if the conditions is not true
In our programs since we are using Objects. We can say IF the pig is clean THEN it moves to the barn
If the pig is not clean then the condition will be FALSE and move to the else condition
Why don't you give it a try now and try to clean the animals with IF statements


I will now explain some rules for this level.
Rule 1: All sentences must begin with "Farmer John".
Rule 2: All sentences must be at least 3 meaningful words long.
Rule 3: After the if keyword you must repeat the animal you are using (ex: farmer john cleans the pig if the pig is clean).
Rule 4: The goal for this level is to make sure all the animals are full, clean and healthy with if statements.
Rule 5: Have fun!.
TIP: Don't forget to milk the cow!
