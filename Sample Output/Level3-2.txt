Welcome to the third level.
Here we will begin teaching about the second condition statement, the WHILE statement.
WHILE functions similar to the IF statement where it will only execute if the statement is true.
The fundamental difference is the while condition will keep going until the statement becomes false
This can be tricky in programming since you can encounter endless loops if your while statement is always true
For this exercise we have made the animals all a certain level of hungry. The conditions statement will be
while (the animal is a hungry) do something.
I think we are ready to give this a try.


I will now explain some rules for this level.
Rule 1: All sentences must begin with "Farmer John".
Rule 2: All sentences must be at least 3 meaningful words long.
Rule 3: After the while keyword you must repeat the animal you are using (ex: farmer john cleans the pig while the pig is clean).
Rule 4: The goal for this level is to make sure all the animals are full using while statements.
Rule 5: Have fun!.
---------------------------------
The Farm is clean.
Farmer John is at the Farm.
The pig is at the Farm. It is full, sick, and filthy.
The chicken is at the Farm. It is hungry, healthy, and filthy.
The cow is at the Farm. It is hungry, sick, clean, and has milk.
